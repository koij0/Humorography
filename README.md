# Humorography - "Giggle Game"

# OVERVIEW
A story of myself within the context of humor. Including specific examples (variety) of my humor and an analysis (graph) compares my humor to the users.

This was a project for McBride Honor's class: where we explore history in the lens of Humor. 

OUTCOME: Applying Technical Skills (such as Python) to create a Creative and Outside-the-Box Project

# NOTES

For my Humorography, I wanted to create a game that demonstrated my relationship with Humor. For me it’s a “give-and-take”: the more laughter a person “gives” towards my Humor, the more they can “take” (or receive). My Humor depends on response and builds by positive feedback. My Humor, in a way, is also a game or a program for me to play and decode. 

So, as the user plays through Humorography ~ Giggle Game, it progresses to different levels depending on the user’s input: YES (“I laughed”) or NO (“I didn’t laugh”). 

The different levels represent the levels of my Humor:

Level 1 - Dad Jokes

Level 2 - General Memes

Level 3 - STEM Memes

Level 4 - Audio Clips

Level 5 - K-pop Memes

If the user selects NO a lot in a level, it bumps back to the previous level. This simulates the fact that if someone doesn’t find a certain Level of my Humor funny, it’ll never progress to the next Level. In other words, without continuous positive response to my Humor, it diminishes. 

Also built into the game, is an option to see the “Giggle Graph” (press the Key “G” to view & Key “B” to Exit Graph), which visualizes how much Humor the user shares with me. The more Green compared to Red, shows that the user has a similar Humor as me.
