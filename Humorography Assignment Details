Humorography (Humor + Autobiography)
 
Construct a story of you within the context of humor. Include specific examples (any variety) and provide analysis that creates a story of you. Here are some inquiries to guide your thinking:
• What story does your humor express about you?*
• What does it communicate to the external world?
• What does it allow you to un/intentionally communicate to your external/internal worlds?
• How do your humor preferences and general sense of humor impact how you see others and how others see you?
• How is your humor a vehicle for processing and expressing your experiences?
• On the flip side, pay close attention to your unlaughter. the humor you reject often reveals your strongest boundaries, values, and sensitivities.
• Finally, if you don’t see yourself as having a sense of humor, why might that be? How do you process all of the moments of humor that happen in the world around you? Etc.
 
At its core, this assignment asks you to move from examples of humor to interpretation, and from interpretation to a story about yourself in the world. We are not pursuing self-disclosure for its own sake, but learning to read humor as a meaning-making system, in yourself and in others, a skill that matters wherever people, power, culture, and communication intersect.
 
Learning Objectives—inquiries you should pursue while completing this assignment:
❖ What is your relationship with humor, as revealed through specific examples?
❖ How does this relationship affect my perception of myself, others, and my experience of my internal/external worlds?
❖ How can I express this relationship for someone else to understand?
 
Learning Outcomes—what you should be able to do by completing this assignment: 
❖ Illustrate a new, developing, or newly articulated understanding of who you are explored through your sense of humor.
❖ Critically analyze examples that illustrate your claims (e.g., moving beyond description to interpretation about what the humor does, signals, or reveals).
❖ Express how humor shapes your perception of the world (e.g. biases, values, experiences, etc.) using written or other interpretive modes of communication in a way that is understandable to others.
 
In meeting these objectives and outcomes, you can be as creative as you want to be! If you choose a creative expression of your Humorography, include a written explanation (e.g. something akin to an artist’s statement) that explains what you are expressing and how it answers the questions that the assignment is asking (i.e. see above in the assignment description and learning objectives).
 
*You are not expected to fully understand your relationship with humor yet, or maybe ever. Productive uncertainty is a strength here.
